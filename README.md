A simple color picker control for WPF.

You can invoke it as a dialog using:

`ColorPickerWPF.ColorPickerWindow.ShowDialog(color);`

Or use the control itself in your application `ColorPickerWPF.ColorPickerControl`

Please note that this is an amateur work and bugs are certainly present. But it might meet your needs.
