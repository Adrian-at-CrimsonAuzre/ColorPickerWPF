# ColorPickerWPF

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drogoganor/ColorPickerWPF/master/images/Picker1.png)

A simple color picker control for WPF licensed under MIT. 

Contains two color gradient images to sample from, and custom palette support.

You can invoke it as a dialog using:

`ColorPickerWPF.ColorPickerWindow.ShowDialog(color);`

Or use the control itself in your application `ColorPickerWPF.ColorPickerControl`

Please note that this is an amateur work and bugs are certainly present. But it might meet your needs.
